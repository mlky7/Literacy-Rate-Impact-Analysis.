# Literacy Rate Impact Analysis.
This project is aligned with **SDG 4: Quality Education** and aims to predict a region’s literacy rate based on government spending on primary education and the number of schools per 1000 children. It also addresses skewed data distributions by applying Log Transformation to ensure the data meets the assumption of normality.
